# Captain Utility Swap
Adds a hotkey for changing captain's utility skill. Simple as.\
The hotkey is, by defualt, T, but can be changed in the config file to be any keypress you want it to be (as long as it has a unity keycode associated with it).

## why?
because the diablo strike is a meme pick, so this is hoping that it'll get me to see how it can actually be useful.

## how does it work?
when you hit the swap key, your skill is replaced with the diablo strike or orbital probe (which one you don't have).\
This mod keeps track of cooldowns and charges of your utilities.\
Additionally, cooldowns will not tick while the skill is inactive, meaning you must be swapped to it to use it more. (both is simple code-wise, but also keeps a bit more balance).
Both are affected by stack-increasing equipment.
